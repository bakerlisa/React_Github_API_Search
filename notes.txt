=============== PART I - Project details ===============
TECHNOLOGIES:
1. SCSS:
    - React has a built in compiler for SASS/SCSS. Using SASS/SCSS in projects means code is more reusable through mixins and variables that aren't as easy to use in vanilla CSS.
    - Also feel it can keep code blocks more contained
2. Axios:
    - used to make github calls
    - easy to implements and updates on the fly use UseEffect
3. Module CSS:
    - Like to implement CSS with modules because it keeps CSS contained and keeps the load time down. It Its not needed it isn't loaded
4. Functional Components:
    - Personal preference. They are cleaner, less verbose, and have the same functionality.

******* Notes for designer or project manager *******
INCONSISTENCY IN THE DESIGN:
1. the wording of the placeholder text changes from 'Search Users' to 'Search for Github Users'
2. Part I has a plain purple background while Part II has a purple background with a dotted texture (this is also present on when hovering over dropdown items)

MISSING ELEMENTS:
1. Icons - I'm using Fontawesome but its thicker than the icon in the DESIGN
2. Font - I don't have access to the typography. One of the back up fonts was Robot, which is a Google font and one I have access to.
    - This might tamper with the exact spacing the client is looking for because Robot thickness and height may not be exact. So I eyeballed it to match the comp

=============== PART II - github API install ===============
Start the project and check visually 


=============== PART III - improvements =============== 
All depends on what the github api is being used for. 

I would like more info on the project itself. How its going to be used. How people will interact with it. Why it's being built in the first place. 

1. A way to save the people you're looking for, that isn't lost on a refresh
