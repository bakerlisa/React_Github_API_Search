=============== PART I - Project details ===============
TECHNOLOGIES:
1. SCSS:
    - React has a built in compiler for SASS/SCSS. Using SASS/SCSS in projects means code is more reusable through mixins and variables that aren't as easy to use in vanilla CSS.
    - Also feel it can keep code blocks more contained
2. Axios:
    - used to make github calls
    - easy to implements and updates on the fly use 
3. Github in a function call:
    - Originally I had it in an UseEffect - BUT when the page loaded it would load ALL the github users. So we moved it to a function 
    - I liked the function because it made it reusable, say we wanted a click functionally.
3. Module CSS:
    - Like to implement CSS with modules because it keeps CSS contained and keeps the load time down. It Its not needed it isn't loaded
4. Functional Components:
    - Personal preference. They are cleaner, less verbose, and have the same functionality.

******* Notes for designer or project manager *******
INCONSISTENCY IN THE DESIGN:
1. the wording of the placeholder text changes from 'Search Users' to 'Search for Github Users'
2. Part I has a plain purple background while Part II has a purple background with a dotted texture (this is also present on when hovering over dropdown items)
3. Looks like the background hover in the dropdown menu is another color of gray not stated in the design constraints

MISSING ELEMENTS:
1. Icons - I'm using Fontawesome but its thicker than the icon in the DESIGN
2. Font - I don't have access to the typography. One of the back up fonts was Robot, which is a Google font and one I have access to.
    - This might tamper with the exact spacing the client is looking for because Robot thickness and height may not be exact. So I eyeballed it to match the comp

=============== PART II - github API install ===============
Start the project and check visually 


=============== PART III - improvements =============== 
All depends on what this project is being used for. 

I would like more info on the project itself. How its going to be used. How people will interact with it. Why it's being built in the first place. 

1. A way to save the people you're looking for, that isn't lost on a refresh
2. What do: hover, focus, and clicked states look like
3. Are they any additional animations the client/manager wants on the site
    - for example does the dropdown just appear, or does it fade in?
4. Does mobile look the same as Desktop? Or is this the desktop version?
5. what happens when I click the search icon?
6. When the user leaves the input what should happen to the dropdown? 
    - if its blank I cleared the state, what if its not empty?
